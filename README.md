# buzzer
                                                          A simple code to work with buzzer in Arduino
 
Buzzers are the main way to create sound with Arduino. They are simple to be connected with two main manners:

1st : This one works with buzzers that possess 3 pins

Arduino         ------------        Buzzer

5V                ---------          VCC

GND               ---------          GND

Digital Pin(4)    ---------          OUT


2nd : This one works with buzzers that possess 2 pins

Arduino         ------------        Buzzer

Digital Pin(4)    ---------          VCC

GND               ---------          GND
